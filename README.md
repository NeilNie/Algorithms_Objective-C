# Algorithms Objective-C
Computer Science Algorthims written in Objective c

You can find many useful algorithms and data structures in computer science in this repo. They are all written in Objective-C. You are more than welcome to contribute this this repo. 

##Why algorithms?
Learning and playing around with algorithms can make you a much better programmer or computer sciencetist. Many people dive into computer science or programming with little background in algorithms. However, with these basic knowledge, you can be the top 10% of programmers.

###Searching & Sorting
Some of the searching and sorting algorithms can be simple and intuitive which others are harder to understand. With these sample projects, you can develop a good understanding for most algorithms and use them in your projects. 

- Linear Search. Find an element in an array.
- Binary Search. Quickly find elements in a sorted array.
- Count Occurrences. Count how often a value appears in an array. (under construction)

###Sorting
The majority of the mainframe computers are sorting as you read this. In this unit, we explore a couple of different sorting algorithms.<br>
1. Merge sort O(nlogn) <br>
2. Quick sort O(nlogn) <br>
3. Radix sort O(wn) <br>
4. Heap sort O(nlogn) <br>
5. Selection sort O(n^2) <br>
6. Insertion sort O(n^2) <br>

####Data structures
- Linked list
- Stacks
- Queue
- Heap
- Priority Queue

###Trees
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Search Tree Visualisation
- The Animal Game

###Other Algorithms
- Palindrome
- Recursion
- GCD
- Recursive Drawings
- Tower of Hanoi
- Reverse String

###Graphs
- Graph
- Breadth-first search: 
    1. Maze solver project
- Depth-first search:
    1. Maze solver project
    2. Sudoku solver project
    (Both project uses depth first search algorithm. Classic problems)
    
Here is a realworld puzzle that we solved with Graphs - [Links to an external site.](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Graphs/TheWordLadderProblem.html)

One of the most interesting and elegant project in this repo. The Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Djikstra's algorithm is a classic algorithm for finding the shortest path through spaces that can be represented by weighted graphs. We wrote an macOS app that solves the shortest path problem between two points in the US.

A nice overview of the programming pioneer Edsger W. Dijkstra, his algorithm, and how Google uses it is here - [Links to an external site.](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-simple-elegant-algorithm-that-makes-google-maps-possible)

The problem is described here - [(Links to an external site.)](http://josephpcohen.com/teaching/cs210/project-2-2/) and here - [(Links to an external site.)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1134/handouts/44-Assignment5.pdf) 

Your goal is to create a visual map of the United States and to show the road (vertex, edge) network represented in the USA.txt files.  You can click any two vertices and find, using Djikstra's algorithm the shortest path from one to the other. There is a visual display of the path as well.
