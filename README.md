# Algorithms Objective-C
Computer Science Algorthims written in Objective c

You can find many useful algorithms and data structures in computer science in this repo. They are all written in Objective-C. You are more than welcome to contribute this this repo. 

##Why algorithms?
Learning and playing around with algorithms can make you a much better programmer or computer sciencetist. Many people dive into computer science or programming with little background in algorithms. However, with these basic knowledge, you can be the top 10% of programmers.
