# Algorithms Objective-C
Computer Science Algorthims written in Objective c

You can find many useful algorithms and data structures in computer science in this repo. They are all written in Objective-C. You are more than welcome to contribute this this repo. 

##Why algorithms?
Learning and playing around with algorithms can make you a much better programmer or computer sciencetist. Many people dive into computer science or programming with little background in algorithms. However, with these basic knowledge, you can be the top 10% of programmers. 

##Contents:
####Searching & Sorting
Some of the searching and sorting algorithms can be simple and intuitive which others are harder to understand. With these sample projects, you can develop a good understanding for most algorithms and use them in your projects. 

- Linear Search. Find an element in an array.
- Binary Search. Quickly find elements in a sorted array.
- Count Occurrences. Count how often a value appears in an array. (under construction)
- Insert Sort
- Merge Sort

####Data structures
- Linked list
- Stacks
- Queue

####Graphs
- Graph (under construction)
- Breadth-first search: 
    1. Maze solver project
- Depth-first search:
    1. Maze solver project
    2. Sudoku solver project
    (Both project uses depth first search algorithm. Classic problems)

####Other Algorithms
- Palindrome
- Recursion
- GCD
- Recursive Drawings
- Tower of Hanoi
- Reverse String


[much more to come]
